## Vein Package

**V**ehicular **E**missions **IN**ventory **(VEIN)** model.

_Please read the documentation_.

### System requirements

vein imports functions from spatial packages listed below. In order to
install these packages, firstly the user must install the requirements
mentioned [here](https://www.github.com/r-spatial/sf).

### Packages needed

After installing system dependencies, you need these packages:

- [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf)
- [sp](https://github.com/edzer/sp/) 
- [units](https://github.com/edzer/units/) 

In order to run the demo, this package is also needed:

- [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)


### Installation

VEIN can be installed via CRAN or github

```{r eval = F}
# 0.3.6 Reaching the puberty   
library(devtools) 
install_github("atmoschem/vein")
library(vein)
demo(VEIN)
```

or

```{r eval=F}
# 0.2.3
install.packages("vein")
library(vein)
```

## What is new on 0.3.0 ?

I decided to jump into a new 'minor' version because it brings lots of cool
improvements.

- vein imports **sf** functions.
- R packages -raster-, -rgdal- and -rgeos- not needed anymore.
- vein now imports **data-table**.
- Add class GriddedEmissionsArray.
- Fix #28, data.table imported in emis_grid. Now it is very fast!
- Fix #49: Documentation in inventory est.
- Fix #50: Fix repetition of x_DF.
- Fix #51: deparse text.
- Fix #52: separate objects in rm with ','
- Fix #55.
- Minor fix on demo(VEIN).
- emis and emis_cold adjust length of ef by length of columns of first
element of the list of data-frames.
- Revised all examples.

### How to use vein

VEIN consist of: "Elaboration of vehicular emissions inventories,
    consisting in four stages, pre-processing activity data, preparing 
    emissions factors, estimating the emissions and post-processing of emissions 
    in maps and databases."

This implies the use of several functions in a coordinates ans structured way,
therefore it is added the new function **inventory** which creates a structured
set of directories and scripts to run VEIN. Please, read the examples in the
documentation of each function and run the demo. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
vein::inventory(name = "YourCity")
```

###  Issues

If you encounter any issues while using VEIN, please submit your issues to: https://github.com/atmoschem/vein/issues/

If you have any suggestions just let me know to sergio.ibarra@usp.br.

Thanks and enjoy VEIN!

### **future steps**

- Estimation of evaporative emissions with Copert Tier 3
- More speciations
- Vignettes, blogs and a book (hopefully released in 2018)
