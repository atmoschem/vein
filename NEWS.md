This is, it returns a data-frame when profile is missing.
What would happen if annaul activity is used when profile?
WHat happen if this profile are normalized projections for future?
The result would be an EmissionsArray with emissions projections.
However, the emission factors would be contant, which would be incorrect
due to emissions degradations. Thusm it would be a good idea start to think
in a dedicated function for top-down estimations, which ideally, would cover
cold start and evaporative cases. Also, what happens for automatic monthly estimation?
Perhaps, 0.7.
