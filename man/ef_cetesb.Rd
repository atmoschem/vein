The percentage varies of biofuels varies by law.

This emission factors are not exactly the same as the report of CETESB.

1) In this emission factors, there is also NO and NO2 based on split by
published in the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook.

2) Also, the emission factors were extended till 50 years of use, repeating
the oldest value.

3) CNG emission factors were expanded to other pollutants by comparison
of US.EPA-AP42 emission factor: Section 1.4 Natural Gas Combustion.

In the previous versions I used the letter 'd' for deteriorated. I removed the
letter 'd' internally to not break older code.

If by mistake, the user inputs one of veh names from the old convention,
they are internally changed to the new convention:
"SLT", "LT", "MT", "SHT","HT", "UB", "SUB", "COACH", "ARTIC", "M_G_150",
"M_G_150_500", "M_G_500", "M_FG_150", "M_FG_150_500", "M_FG_500",
"M_FE_150", "M_FE_150_500","M_FE_500",
PC_ELEC, LCV_ELEC, TRUCKS_ELEC, BUS_ELEC,
MC_150_ELEC, MC_150_500_ELEC, MC_500_ELEC

If pollutant is "SO2", it needs sppm. It is designed when veh has length 1, if it has length 2 or more,
it will show a warning

\strong{Emission factor for vehicles older than the reported by CETESB were filled with las highest EF}

\itemize{
\item Range EF from PC and LCV otto: 2018 - 1982. EF for 1981 and older as moving average.
\item Range LCV diesel : 2018 - 2006. EF for 2005 and older as moving average.

Currently, 2020, there are not any system for recovery of fuel vapors in Brazil. Hence,
the FS takes into account the vapour that comes from the fuel tank inside the car and
released into the atmosphere when injecting new fuel. There are discussions about
increasing implementing stage I and II and/or ORVR these days. The ef FS is calculated
by transforming g FC/km into  (L/KM)*g/L with g/L 1.14 fgor gasoline and 0.37
for ethanol (CETESB, 2016). The density considered is 0.75425 for gasoline and
0.809 for ethanol (t/m^3)

CETESB emission factors did not cover evaporative emissions from motorcycles,
which occur. Therefore, in the absence of better data, it was assumed the
same ratio from passenger cars.

with ethanol gasoline blends." Science of the Total Environment 502 (2015): 627-631.

Emission factors for resuspension applies \strong{only} with top-down approach
as a experimental feature. Units are g/(streets*veh)/day. These values were
derived form a bottom-up resuspension emissions from metropolitan area
of Sao Paulo 2018, assuming 50000 streets

NH3 from EEA Tier 2
