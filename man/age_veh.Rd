\usage{

  x,

\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric; numerical vector of vehicles with length equal to lines features of road network}

\item{type}{"ldv", "hdv", or "mc" representing light vehicles, heavy vehicles or motorcycles}

\item{name}{Character; of vehicle assigned to columns of dataframe}

\item{a}{Numeric; parameter of survival equation}

\item{b}{Numeric; parameter of survival equation}

\item{agemin}{Integer; age of newest vehicles for that category}

\item{agemax}{Integer; age of oldest vehicles for that category}

\item{k}{Numeric; multiplication factor. If its length is > 1, it must match the length of x}

\item{bystreet}{Logical; when TRUE it is expecting that 'a' and 'b' are numeric vectors with length equal to x}

\item{net}{SpatialLinesDataFrame or Spatial Feature of "LINESTRING"}

\item{verbose}{Logical;  message with average age and total numer of vehicles}

\item{namerows}{Any vector to be change row.names. For instance, name of
regions or streets.}

\item{time}{Character to be the time units as denominator, eg "1/h"}
}

\description{
\code{\link{age_veh}} returns amount of vehicles at each age
}
\note{
The functions age* produce distribution of the circulating fleet by age of use.
The order of using these functions is:

1. If you know the distribution of the vehicles by age of use , use:  \code{\link{my_age}}
2. If you know the sales of vehicles, or the registry of new vehicles,
use \code{\link{age}} to apply a survival function.
3. If you know the theoretical shape of the circulating fleet and you can use
\code{\link{age_ldv}}, \code{\link{age_hdv}} or \code{\link{age_moto}}. For instance,
you dont know the sales or registry of vehicles, but somehow you know
the shape of this curve.
4. You can use/merge/transform/adapt any of these functions.
